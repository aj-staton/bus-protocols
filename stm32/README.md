# The ARM-Based STM32F3
These are personal projects I have done using the STM32F3 Discovery board.
My goal is to interface with this board using both C, which I'm familiar with,
and Rust, which I'm not.

It's specs include:
 * an ARM Cortex M4 Core,
 * 256 KiB of Flash memory,
 * 48 KiB of RAM,
 * non-essentials such as LEDs, buttons, a gyroscope, external power supply, an
 e-compass, etc.
