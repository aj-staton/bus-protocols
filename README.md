# MicroControllers
These are projects for CSCE 317, Computer Systems Engineering at the University of South Carolina, Columbia. The course is lab-based around embedded systems and thier communication protocols.

During my time in this course, the unfortunate events of COVID-19 occured globally. This forced instruction to be moved online. 
The [UART](#UART) project was completed in-person, completed with the Atmel Atmega 328p. The other projects, in the "virtual classroom," were written locally and them simulated/tested with SystemVerilog. 

## UART
Wrote a software-defined implementation of UART communication using GPIO pins on the AVR-based Atmel Atmega 328p microcontroller.

## SPI
Wrote a software-defined implementation of SPI comunication which was tested by simulation in HDL.

### Credits
This course was taught by Dr. Jason. D. Bakos in the Spring of 2020; the Teaching Assistant was Charles Daniels.
