# Computer Systems Engineering
These are projects for CSCE 317, Computer Systems Engineering at the University of South Carolina Columbia. The course is lab-based around embedded systems and thier application and development. All code in the course was bare metal code. 

#### The Hardware
The Atmel Atmega328 was used for all labs in the course--its [datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf) has more information on its specifications. In summary, it's an :
*8-bit microcontroller that uses a RISC architecture,
*Is compatible with SPI, I2C, and USART,
*Will use the AVR instruction set.

## Credits
This course was taught by Dr. Jason. D. Bakos in the Spring of 2020; the Teaching assistant was Charles Daniels.
